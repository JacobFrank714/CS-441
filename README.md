The oustline for the lexer was from : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32928656/racket-define-one-character-with-token-char
I did motify for my own purposes but much of the coding for the lexer was from there.

The only imports that I used was in the lexer. I used a (require parser-tools/lex) to simplify the lexer code.
